# Pythagorean-Triplets-Checker
This is a Python Program to determine all Pythagorean triplets till the upper limit.

# Problem Description
The program takes a upper limit and determines all Pythagorean triplets till the upper limit.

# Problem Solution
1. Take in the upper limit and store it in a variable.
2. Using a while loop and for loop, compute the Pythagorean triplets using the formula.
3. If the value of the c is greater than the upper limit or if any of the numbers is equal to 0, break from the loop.
4. Print all the three numbers of the Pythagorean triplets.
5. Exit.

# Program Explanation
1. User must enter the upper limit and store it in a variable.
2. The while and for loop is used to find the value of the Pythagorean triplets using the formula.
3. If the value of a side is greater than the upper limit or if any of the side is 0, the loop is broken out of.
4. Then the triplets are printed.
